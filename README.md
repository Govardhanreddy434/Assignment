# Fermat's Last Theorem Near Misses Finder

## Description

This Python program allows users to find "near misses" for Fermat's Last Theorem equation: `x^n + y^n = z^n`, where `x`, `y`, `z`, `n`, and `k` are integers. The program helps the user search for the smallest relative miss for this equation over a range of values.

### Features:
- The user provides input for the exponent `n` (where `2 < n < 12`) and a maximum value `k` (where `k > 10`) for `x` and `y`.
- The program calculates the smallest relative miss and outputs the best `(x, y)` values.

## Prerequisites

To run this program, you need:
- Python 3.x installed on your system.
